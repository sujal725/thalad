Least Connections Distribution:
  Backend 1: 3 requests, avg_time: 0.080s
  Backend 2: 3 requests, avg_time: 0.200s
  Backend 3: 3 requests, avg_time: 0.100s

=== SIMULATION COMPLETE ===

KEY DIFFERENCES:
• Round Robin: Equal distribution regardless of load
• Least Connections: Dynamic distribution based on active connections
