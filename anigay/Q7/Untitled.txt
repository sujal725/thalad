=== BULLY ELECTION ALGORITHM ===

Creating nodes with priorities (higher ID = higher priority):
  Node 1: Priority 1
  Node 2: Priority 2
  Node 3: Priority 3
  Node 4: Priority 4
  Node 5: Priority 5

--- SCENARIO 1: Initial Election ---

[Node 5] Starting BULLY ELECTION
[Node 5] ELECTED as COORDINATOR
[Node 5] Announcing leadership to all nodes
[Node 1] Acknowledged Node 5 as coordinator
[Node 2] Acknowledged Node 5 as coordinator
[Node 3] Acknowledged Node 5 as coordinator
[Node 4] Acknowledged Node 5 as coordinator

Coordinator after election: 5

--- SCENARIO 2: Coordinator Crash ---
[Node 5] CRASHED

--- SCENARIO 3: New Election After Crash ---

[Node 3] Starting BULLY ELECTION
[Node 3] Sending election messages to: [4]
[Node 4] Received election from Node 3

[Node 4] Starting BULLY ELECTION
[Node 4] ELECTED as COORDINATOR
[Node 4] Announcing leadership to all nodes
[Node 1] Acknowledged Node 4 as coordinator
[Node 2] Acknowledged Node 4 as coordinator
[Node 3] Acknowledged Node 4 as coordinator

New Coordinator: 4

--- SCENARIO 4: Node Recovery ---
[Node 5] RECOVERED

[Node 5] Starting BULLY ELECTION
[Node 5] ELECTED as COORDINATOR
[Node 5] Announcing leadership to all nodes
[Node 1] Acknowledged Node 5 as coordinator
[Node 2] Acknowledged Node 5 as coordinator
[Node 3] Acknowledged Node 5 as coordinator
[Node 4] Acknowledged Node 5 as coordinator

Final Coordinator: 4
