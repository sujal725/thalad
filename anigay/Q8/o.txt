=== RING ELECTION ALGORITHM ===

Ring: 0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 0

--- SCENARIO 1: Initial Election ---

[Node 0] Starting RING ELECTION
[Node 0] → Passing [0] to Node 1
[Node 1] Received [0]
[Node 1] → Passing [0, 1] to Node 2
[Node 2] Received [0, 1]
[Node 2] → Passing [0, 1, 2] to Node 3
[Node 3] Received [0, 1, 2]
[Node 3] → Passing [0, 1, 2, 3] to Node 4
[Node 4] Received [0, 1, 2, 3]
[Node 4] → Passing [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] to Node 0
[Node 0] Received [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

[Node 0] ELECTION COMPLETE. Coordinator = Node 4

[Node 0] Acknowledged Node 4 as COORDINATOR
[Node 1] Acknowledged Node 4 as COORDINATOR
[Node 2] Acknowledged Node 4 as COORDINATOR
[Node 3] Acknowledged Node 4 as COORDINATOR
[Node 4] Acknowledged Node 4 as COORDINATOR
Coordinator: Node 4

--- SCENARIO 2: Coordinator Crash ---
[Node 4] CRASHED

--- SCENARIO 3: New Election After Crash ---

[Node 1] Starting RING ELECTION
[Node 1] → Passing [1] to Node 2
[Node 2] Received [1]
[Node 2] → Passing [1, 2] to Node 3
[Node 3] Received [1, 2]
[Node 3] → Passing [1, 2, 3] to Node 0
[Node 0] Received [1, 2, 3]
[Node 0] → Passing [1, 2, 3, 0] to Node 1
[Node 1] Received [1, 2, 3, 0]

[Node 1] ELECTION COMPLETE. Coordinator = Node 3

[Node 0] Acknowledged Node 3 as COORDINATOR
[Node 1] Acknowledged Node 3 as COORDINATOR
[Node 2] Acknowledged Node 3 as COORDINATOR
[Node 3] Acknowledged Node 3 as COORDINATOR
New Coordinator: Node 3

--- SCENARIO 4: Multiple Node Failures ---
[Node 3] CRASHED
[Node 0] CRASHED

--- SCENARIO 5: Election with Node Down ---

[Node 1] Starting RING ELECTION
[Node 1] → Passing [1] to Node 2
[Node 2] Received [1]
[Node 2] → Passing [1, 2] to Node 1
[Node 1] Received [1, 2]

[Node 1] ELECTION COMPLETE. Coordinator = Node 2

[Node 1] Acknowledged Node 2 as COORDINATOR
[Node 2] Acknowledged Node 2 as COORDINATOR
Final Coordinator: Node 2
